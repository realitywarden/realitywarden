# Open Reality Studio Desktop

Open Reality Studio Desktop is an early desktop prototype for simulation-first AI device development.

It is a local virtual lab for building, simulating, testing, debugging, and validating AI-controlled device workflows before touching real hardware.

No hardware required.

## Public Alpha Status

This repository is currently a **simulation-only Public Alpha**.

Current public alpha support is intentionally narrow:

- `robot_arm`
- `smart_light`
- `camera_sensor`

These three device paths are the only ones treated as runnable in the main desktop Run flow.

Everything else is still scaffolded or **Coming Soon**.

Same protocol for simulation and future real devices.

Demo video: Coming soon

## What This Alpha Does

- Runs a desktop virtual lab UI
- Compiles prompts into safe simulated execution flows
- Shows command-driven virtual-device playback
- Runs Safety Runtime before simulated execution
- Produces adapter commands, execution timeline, and Lab Report
- Supports project/workspace state inside the desktop workbench

## What This Alpha Does Not Do

- No real device execution
- No production hardware control
- No certified industrial safety guarantee
- No cloud runtime
- No marketplace
- No LocalRuntime / EdgeRuntime for real hardware yet

## Supported Public Alpha Device Paths

| Device Type | Main Run | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `robot_arm` | Yes | Golden-path autonomy + playback demo |
| `smart_light` | Yes | Limited low-risk natural-language simulation run |
| `camera_sensor` | Yes | Limited low-risk natural-language simulation run |
| `mobile_robot` | No | Coming Soon |
| `conveyor_belt` | No | Coming Soon |
| `plc_cabinet` | No | Coming Soon |
| `lab_instrument` | No | Coming Soon |
| `warehouse_rack` | No | Coming Soon |
| `sensor_box` | No | Coming Soon |

See [docs/DEVICE_SUPPORT.md](./docs/DEVICE_SUPPORT.md) for the exact support matrix.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run web development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run the desktop shell:

```bash
npm run desktop:dev
```

Build the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run TypeScript checks:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Run verification:

```bash
npm run verify
```

## Execution Model

Simulation path:

```text
Prompt
-> Device Profile
-> Task DSL
-> Safety Runtime
-> Adapter Commands
-> Virtual Device Runtime
-> Lab Report
```

For `robot_arm`, the main path also includes the current `AutonomyCore` / `RiskJudge` chain before simulated execution.

## Natural Language Boundary

Natural-language support is not universal.

- `robot_arm` supports the current golden-path AI command flow.
- `smart_light` supports a limited set of low-risk Chinese/English prompts.
- `camera_sensor` supports a limited set of low-risk Chinese/English prompts.
- Unsupported prompts must fail clearly and must not silently fall back into execution.

## Asset Boundary

Built-in assets are **generic industrial-style assets**.

They do **not** use unauthorized vendor logos, trademarks, or vendor CAD files.

## Future Real Device Adapter Boundary

The repository keeps future-facing adapter abstractions, but **real device execution is not part of this Public Alpha**.

Future real-device work must remain behind:

- certified adapters
- verified transport
- local safety enforcement
- human supervision
